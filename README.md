# Procman

A process manager for local development on macOS.

Install:

```bash
go install github.com/croaky/procman@latest
```

Define your processes in `Procfile.dev`. For example:

```txt
clock: bundle exec ruby schedule/clock.rb
esbuild: npm run buildwatch
queues: bundle exec ruby queues/poll.rb
web: bundle exec puma -p 3000 -C ./config/puma.rb
```

Run processes by naming them in a comma-delimited list:

```bash
procman esbuild,web
```

You must list at least one process.
There are no options or flags.

The output from multiple processes will be combined. For example:

```txt
esbuild | 
esbuild | > buildwatch
esbuild | > node build.mjs --watch
esbuild | 
esbuild | watching...
